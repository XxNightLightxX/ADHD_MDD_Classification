# ADHD_MDD_Classification
This is a collection of classification models (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Hybrid Classifier models) which are used for the detection and classification of ADHD and MDD with the help of extracting linear and morphological features using EEG signals.
There is also a prediction model made using a Voting Classifier.

# Setup 

-> Upload the ipynb file of choice into either Google Colab (Recommended) or a Jupytr Notebook and run it directly. <br>
-> For training the model, the dataset should be stored in the location you specify in the program.

# Dataset
